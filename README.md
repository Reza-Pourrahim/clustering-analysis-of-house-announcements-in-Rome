<H3>This work includes two stages:</H3>

**1) Does basic house information reflect house's description? (Web Scraping - Clustering)** <br>
In this assignment we perform a clustering analysis of house announcements in Rome from Immobiliare.it. we implement two clustering and compare the results we get. For this end, first, we create two datasets and each of them filled by data that we scraped.
<br>
<br>
**2) Find the duplicates! (Hashing)** <br>
We have a passwords2.txt file as input. Each row corresponds to a string of 20 characters. we will define a hash function that associates a value to each string. In this case, the goal is to check whether there are some duplicate strings.
